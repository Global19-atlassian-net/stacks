# Contributing to Docker Stacks

This repository is still work in progress. We made this repository public so that
we can discuss the design and progress with the community, but are still putting 
things in shape.

With things moving fast, we may not be able to review, or accept pull-requests,
or reply to issues in a timely fashion at this time (but we'll try to have a
look - bear with us ðŸ¤—).

Thank you for your understanding!
